Welcome to my unofficial course notes for the final exam of CS245(Summer 2014)\\

The course material that has influenced the contents of these course notes are as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item Course Textbook.
\item Course slides.
\item Posts on the CS245 Piazza.
\item Student perspectives.

\end{itemize}

To preserve the chronological order that the material was presented during lecture, these review notes will follow a similar structure. However, some material in these review notes may be introduced earlier or later. This will only occur if we feel as if material flows better in a separate section than it was originally introduced in.\\
