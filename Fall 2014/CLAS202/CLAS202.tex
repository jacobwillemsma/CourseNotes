It will touch on the architechture, culture, emperors, mathematicians, artists, the art the entertainment the decadence and everything in between of Roman society. \\

We will begin with how we have found out so much about this ancient society. \\

\section{Sources for Roman Society}

There is truly a staggering amount of content from ancient Rome.  So much so that when Rome built their subway they had to continuously push back the completion date because as soon as they dug down they found all sorts of neat, Roman, artifacts. \\

\subsection{Literature}
\begin{itemize}
\item Massive amount of literature

\subsection{What we don't find}
\begin{itemize}
\item We don't find graves.  Does likely to the fact that the Romans cremated their dead.
\item Occasionally we find a body and get excited, we pull conclusions (is this a good idea? Probably not).
\end{itemize}

\section{Geographical Background}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Roman world is the Mediterranean World.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item 7600km of coastline.

	\end{itemize}
\item Italian mountain ranges and rivers:

	\item Alps to the north of Italy, forming a natural border.

\section{The Monarchy (753-510BC)}
\subsection{The Founding of Rome}

\begin{itemize}
\item Founding of Rome was likely very boring, probably just farmers on a hilltop who eventually began a town and then a city.
\item However, to assert the divine creation of Rome, myth is invented.
\item So the story goes:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item A Vestal Virgin is impregnated by Mars and gives birth to \textbf{Romulus and Remus}.
	\item Her brother is upset and wants to kill the children.
	\item Like any good mother, she puts the children in a wicker basket and sends them down the Tiber.
	\item They are taken in by a \emph{She-wolf} who raises them as her own.
	\item Romulus eventually in his adulthood kills Remus.
	\item Romulus becomes the first Etruscan king of Rome (7 total - divine number).
	\item Rome officially founded April 21, 8:05 AM, \textbf{753 BCE}.
	\item \textbf{Pomoerium} is the ``sacred'' boundary.
	\item At first there is only men in Rome, so the Romans arrange a party for their neighbors and once they are drunk, steal and rape their women.
		\begin{itemize} \item Raped women love Rome so much, they stay. \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Kings}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each king (\textbf{Rex}) has two \textbf{Lictors} which are attendants of the King.  Later they become magistrates (judges).
\item The Lictors carried \textbf{Fasces}, bundles of rods and axes.  Often seen during victory parades, which happened pretty often.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Classes}
\begin{itemize}
\item The people of early Rome had a very specific class system, broken down into two categories:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Patricians

		\item Make up 10\% - 20\%
		\end{itemize}

	\item Your name was a compound name.
	\item Given Name + Clan Name + Family Name
	\end{itemize}
