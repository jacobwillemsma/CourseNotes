Welcome to CLAS202 - Ancient Roman Society.  This course will have a particular focus on the earlier empire of Rome.  This course also has something for everyone.  It will touch on the architechture, culture, emperors, mathematicians, artists, the art the entertainment the decadence and everything in between of Roman society. \\

We will begin with how we have found out so much about this ancient society. \\

\section{Sources for Roman Society}

There is truly a staggering amount of content from ancient Rome.  So much so that when Rome built their subway they had to continuously push back the completion date because as soon as they dug down they found all sorts of neat, Roman, artifacts. \\

\subsection{Literature}
\begin{itemize}
\item Massive amount of literature

\end{itemize}

\subsection{What we don't find}
\begin{itemize}
\item We don't find graves.  Does likely to the fact that the Romans cremated their dead.
\item Occasionally we find a body and get excited, we pull conclusions (is this a good idea? Probably not).
\end{itemize}

\section{Geographical Background}
\begin{itemize}

	\item Alps to the north of Italy, forming a natural border.
	\item Apennines down the center, making east/west travel a little difficult.
