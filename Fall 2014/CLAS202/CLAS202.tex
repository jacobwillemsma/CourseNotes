It will touch on the architechture, culture, emperors, mathematicians, artists, the art the entertainment the decadence and everything in between of Roman society. \\

We will begin with how we have found out so much about this ancient society. \\

\section{Sources for Roman Society}

There is truly a staggering amount of content from ancient Rome.  So much so that when Rome built their subway they had to continuously push back the completion date because as soon as they dug down they found all sorts of neat, Roman, artifacts. \\

\subsection{Literature}

\subsection{What we don't find}
\begin{itemize}

\section{The Monarchy (753-510BC)}
\subsection{The Founding of Rome}

\begin{itemize}
\item Founding of Rome was likely very boring, probably just farmers on a hilltop who eventually began a town and then a city.
\item However, to assert the divine creation of Rome, myth is invented.
\item So the story goes:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item A Vestal Virgin is impregnated by Mars and gives birth to \textbf{Romulus and Remus}.
	\item Her brother is upset and wants to kill the children.
	\item Like any good mother, she puts the children in a wicker basket and sends them down the Tiber.
	\item They are taken in by a \emph{She-wolf} who raises them as her own.
	\item Romulus eventually in his adulthood kills Remus.
	\item Romulus becomes the first Etruscan king of Rome (7 total - divine number).
	\item Rome officially founded April 21, 8:05 AM, \textbf{753 BCE}.
	\item \textbf{Pomoerium} is the ``sacred'' boundary.
	\item At first there is only men in Rome, so the Romans arrange a party for their neighbors and once they are drunk, steal and rape their women.
		\begin{itemize} \item Raped women love Rome so much, they stay. \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Kings}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each king (\textbf{Rex}) has two \textbf{Lictors} which are attendants of the King.  Later they become magistrates (judges).
\item The Lictors carried \textbf{Fasces}, bundles of rods and axes.  Often seen during victory parades, which happened pretty often.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Classes}
\begin{itemize}
\item The people of early Rome had a very specific class system, broken down into two categories:

		\end{itemize}

\subsection{Vitruvius - De Architectura “On Architecture”}
\begin{itemize}
\item Wrote during the 1st century BCE (20’s BCE) during the construction boom of Augustus
\item wrote10 volumes on engineering and architecture
\item Only surviving Roman text on the subject
\item Believed that engineers should be well-educated and well-rounded in the following:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item liberal arts
	\item surveying
	\item drafting

\item First developed in late 3rd century BCE
	\begin{itemize}
	\item walls built with a mixture of mortar and small stones, called opus caementicium
	\item Vitruvius describes mortar as a mix of pozzolana (a volcanic ash from Puteoli), lime, water, and small (aggregate) stones
	\item found that it could be shaped into any form and hardened like stone
	\item no longer needed stones to fit perfectly together
	\item allowed the construction of larger, broader buildings and domes
	\item ability to set and harden under water allows the building of bridges and harbors quickly and easily
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Occupations}
\begin{itemize}
\item urban plebs: idle rabble, or work-force?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item most hired as day labourers (menial work)
	\item Forum as labour pool; pay 1 denarius per day
	\item keep poor busy and happy
	\end{itemize}
\item stigma against undignified jobs (manual work for wages; factories; tax collection; retailing; food services, perfume, entertaining, fish sellers, butchers, cooks, poultry raisers, fishermen, salesmen, peddlers and porters)
\item regular wages are suitable only for slaves
\item respectable workers are paid for the item produced or the service performed
\item good jobs: art, medicine (only if you are really good at it!), architecture, teaching
\item FARMING is the most noble occupation
\item other factors in finding a job: training, money, talent, inclination
	\begin{itemize}

	\end{itemize}
\item tombstones name professions or show them in relief
\item 200+ different jobs attested, largely at Rome (some jobs regional)

	\item ie local wines, pottery styles, fishermen and shepherds
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Woman's occupations}

\item Patrician women don’t work, but plebeians do:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item work mostly in service trades (catering, nursing, prostitution, shepherd comfort girl!)
	\item tabernae (barmaid, cook “hostess”)
	\item "feminine" crafts (weaving, laundry, crafts)
	\item often learned their trade at a young age
	\item Epitaphs for Viccentia, a 9 year old gold worker, and Pieris, a 9 year old hair dresser
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Communications}
\subsection{Roman Roads}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rome builds 120,000 km of roads
	\begin{itemize}
	\item communication, trade and military uses
	\end{itemize}
\item Appian Way (road from Rome to Capua)

\item 4.5 m wide, with a 120 cm foundation
\item larger stones under smaller stones and cement
\item Topped with gravel, flint and slabs
\item 1 Roman mile = 1,000 paces
\item “Mile” comes from the Latin “milia passuum” ("one thousand of paces“), which was approximately 1620 yards, 1480 meters
\item each mile marked by a 2-metre tall pillar, called a Milestone (miliarium)
\item A circular column on a solid rectangular base is a milestone or miliarium.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item set two feet into the ground
	\item 2 metres tall
	\item 20" in diameter
	\item weigh about 2 tons
	\end{itemize}
\item Base was inscribed the number of the mile relative to the road it was on
\item A panel at eye-height indicated the distance to the Roman forum
	\begin{itemize}
	\item plus officials who made or repaired the road and when
	\end{itemize}
\item Rome builds many bridges as part of the road system
	\begin{itemize}
	\item originally wooden
	\item later permanent stone bridges replace wooden bridges
	\end{itemize}
\item Roman army engineers learn to build temporary collapsible bridges and pontoon bridges
	\begin{itemize}
	\item  Trajan’s column depicts pontoon bridge across the Danube built in 104CE
	\item  Civilian and military uses
	\end{itemize}
\item curatores viarum (local officials in charge of roads)
	\begin{itemize}
	\item look after their own section of road
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item all get a cut of profits
	\item protect local industries
	\end{itemize}
\item precious metals leave the empire to pay for oriental goods (trade ties as far as India and China)
	\begin{itemize}
	\item much money goes out, but less comes in as Roman expansion stops
	\item creates inflation and stalled economy
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}	

\subsection{Transportation and communication by boat}

\item water transport:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item much cheaper and faster than road
	\item safest to sail during the summer (April to October), vs stormy months of winter
	\item sail by sun at day and by stars at night
	\item most only sail by day
	\end{itemize}
\item Alexandria (chief port of Egypt)
	\begin{itemize}
	\item grain freighters carry 200-3,000 tons each
	\item commercial fleet (naves onerariae)

	\item amphoras (clay shipping containers)
	\end{itemize}
\item shipping hazards
\item Storm

\subsubsection{How Large was Rome’s Merchant Marine?}
\begin{itemize}
\item If we just consider the number of ships needed to feed Rome:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item assume the average inhabitant of Rome ate 237kg of wheat per year
	\item Rome’s population of 1 million requires 237,000 metric tons of wheat per year
	\item average Roman cargo ship holds 250 tons of wheat
	\item this requires 948 shiploads of wheat per year
	\item considering the high rate of spoilage at sea and lost ships, Rome alone would require perhaps 1,300 ships of grain/year just to provide the basic needs of whea
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Travel Times}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rome to Cologne (land) - 67 days
\item Rome to Carthage (sea) - Minimum 2 days, Normal 10
\item Rome to Alexandria (sea) - Minimum 9 days, Normal 41
\item Rome to Antioch - 124 days by land + 2 days by sea
\end{itemize}
