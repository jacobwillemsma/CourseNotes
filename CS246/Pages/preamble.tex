Welcome to the Midterm addition of the CS246 course notes that I will be creating and updating through the term.  These notes are not aimed to replace lectures, tutorials, labs, office hours with your professor or TA, Piazza, or any other source directly provided by the course and the University of Waterloo.  These notes are for the sole purpose of reviewing and as a resource for students interested in the course.\\

The course material that has influenced the contents of these course notes are as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item Lectures run by Brad Lushman, PhD
\item "Absolute C++", textbook for the course.
\item Posts on the CS246 Piazza.
\item Student perspectives.

\end{itemize}

To preserve the chronological order that the material was presented during lecture, these review notes will follow a similar structure. However, some material in these review notes may be introduced earlier or later. This will only occur if we feel as if material flows better in a separate section than it was originally introduced in.\\

Practice exercises can be found scattered throughout each section of the review notes. There is a special section at the end dedicated to sample problems based on emphasized course material, struggling assignment questions and other factors.\\
